First project using a JSON file to populate into my HTML. jQuery and specifically .getJSON to pull data that was used primarily in this project to display as well as using GoogleMaps API to display longitude and latitude in a map to show locations. Biggest challenge I had in this project was creating a long concatination to display my JSON data and connecting it to GoogleMaps. The main take away I had from this project was a better understanding on jQuery and using concatination, I was also happy to learn how to use different API's like GoogleMaps.
